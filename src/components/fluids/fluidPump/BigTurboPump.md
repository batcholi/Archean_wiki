# Description
The Big Turbo pump is a component used to transfer high-density fluid up to 100 kg per second.

# Usage
## Power Supply
To use the pump, it needs to be powered by high-voltage. It consumes up to 100 kw when running at full speed.

## Data
The data port allows controlling the pump speed by sending a value between `-1` and `1`.
When the pump is connected to a computer, it can also retrieve the current flow rate.

> When sending a negative value, the pump will effectively run in reverse.

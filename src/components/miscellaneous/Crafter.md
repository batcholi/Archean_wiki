> Informations:
>- When `progress` in the output data is `-1`, it means that the recipe cannot be performed either due to missing resources or the requested craft does not exist in the game.
>- Even though the Crafter only has two fluid ports, it can use as much fluid as needed for recipes by using [Fluid Junctions](../fluids/FluidJunction.md), which can be connected to all necessary fluid sources. The Crafter will simply use them when needed.

> Hints:
> - You can simply use a [Toggle Button](../controllers/ToggleButton.md) to start continuous crafting as long as the button is active and there are enough resources in the connected inventory.

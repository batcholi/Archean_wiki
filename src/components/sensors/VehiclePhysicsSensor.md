# Description
The Vehicle Physics Sensor is a component that provides information about the vehicle's physics state, mass, size, center of mass, and G-force.

# Usage
Once placed on your build, the sensor can be connected to a computer to retrieve information about the vehicle's physics. Here are the information you can retrieve:
- Active Physics: Indicates whether the physics is active or not.
- Mass: The mass of the vehicle.
- Size (X,Y,Z): The bounding size of the vehicle.
- Center of Mass (X,Y,Z): The position of the center of mass relative to the sensor's position.
- G-force (X,Y,Z): The G-force relative to the sensor's orientation.

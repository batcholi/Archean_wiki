# Description
The Mini Router is a smaller variant of the [Router](Router.md) that only has 14 data ports.

It requires a low-voltage power supply to operate and consumes 50 watts.

Like the standard Router, it allows assigning aliases to components and can be chained with other routers to expand the network.

> The Mini Router that communicates directly with a computer must be powered. Other routers in the chain don't require power and can be used as a [Data Bridge](DataBridge.md) while still being capable of resolving aliases and screen references.

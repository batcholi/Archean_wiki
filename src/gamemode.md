# Game modes
In Archean, there are different game modes. Each game mode has its own rules and objectives based on the type of player you are.

### Creative
In creative mode, you have access to all the blocks and items in the game directly in your inventory. You can freely build any structures and vehicles you want. Here are the specific characteristics of creative mode:
- Blueprints can be loaded without having the necessary components.
- The OwnerPad checkpoint system saves the state of batteries and tanks.
- The respawn shortcut accessible via `Shift+F10` allows you to respawn without dropping the contents of your inventory.
- Mining and crafting are available, but not necessary for building structures or vehicles.
- Fluid temperature can be set manually via GetInfo (V) on tanks and volumes.

> You can reset your inventory using the RESET button available at the top of your inventory.


### Adventure
In adventure mode, you start with an empty inventory and must collect resources to craft the necessary components for building structures and vehicles. Here are the specific characteristics of adventure mode:
- Blueprints cannot be loaded without having the necessary components in your inventory.
- The OwnerPad checkpoint system does not restore the state of batteries and tanks.
- The respawn shortcut accessible via `Shift+F10` drops the contents of your inventory in a box at your location before the respawn.
- Mining and crafting are necessary for building structures or vehicles.
- **Avatar inventory is limited to 48 slots.**
- **Items in your inventory have mass**, which affects your movement speed and the mass of any build you're aboard.

### Survival
The survival mode is not yet available in the game. It will be added in a future update.
